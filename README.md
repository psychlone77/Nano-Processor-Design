## Program ROM - DONE âœ…

**Note**:<br>
Simple Lookup table, uses 13-bit instructions so we can add include some more additional instructions if we need.

## 3-Bit Adder - DONE âœ…

**Note**:<br>
Adder only has one input, other input is always 1
Once '111' is reached the output will reset to '000' and C_out will become '1', which could be useful to indicate an end of program instructions.

## 2-way 3-bit Mulitplexer - Edit made ðŸŸ¡

**Note**:<br>
When Selector is 0 Line0 will be passed and Selector is 1, Line 1 will be passed.

## Program Counter - DONE âœ…
**Note**:<br>
Program Counter has an input and a output. While output will only be set when the clock edge is 'falling'.
